## [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/dpiloni/Time-Series-Analysis)
* Fitted ARMA and GARCH models to financial time series
* Identified Exponential GARCH(1,1) as the generation process of the series

## [MSc Thesis | Hedge fund and Portfolio Diversification. An Empirical Analysis](https://github.com/dpiloni/MSc-Thesis-Hedge-fund-and-Portfolio-Diversification.-An-Empirical-Analysis)
### (Original title: Gli hedge fund e la diversificazione di portafoglio. Un'analisi empirica)
* Identified which hedge fund strategies are able to decorrelate from stock and bond markets, especially during bear market phases, and if this feature can deliver benefits to a diversified portfolio (increase of risk-adjusted performance and/or maximum drawdown reduction)
* Managed Futures  and  Equity Market Neutral are the only strategies that show negative or low correlation during market crises
* Decorrelation ability is not a key feature in diversified portfolios: hedge funds seem more useful to boost performance, rather than to represent a well diversified asset class.
* The most efficient strategies are Global Macro, Long/Short Equity and Distressed Securities
